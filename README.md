# SlicerPipelines
SlicerPipelines is an extension for 3DSlicer that offers the ability to create simple modules (aka pipelines) via a GUI interface with no coding knowledge needed.

In general, the SlicerPipelines extension is meant to help improve efficiency when dealing with simple workflows. Two main modules currently exist, a PipelineCreator module that allows for the creation of pipelines, and a PipelineCaseIterator module that allows for automated running of a pipeline over all files in a directory.
