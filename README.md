SlicerPipelines is an extension for 3D Slicer that offers the ability to create simple modules (aka pipelines) via a GUI interface with no coding knowledge needed.


## Overview

In general, the SlicerPipelines extension is meant to help improve efficiency when dealing with simple workflows. Two main modules currently exist, a PipelineCreator module that allows for the creation of pipelines, and a PipelineCaseIterator module that allows for automated running of a pipeline over all files in a directory.
